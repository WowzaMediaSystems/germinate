==========  ====================================================================
2015-03-10  Began v2.0.0 - Major overhaul to the germinate/shrivel processes. 
            - Added the ability to configure a Seed file to behave better in the
              event of a missing model, or an Exception.
            - Added better tracking of seed status in the database table.
            - Removed the "plant" functionality, because it can be more easily
              managed through a rake task if someone needs repeated database
              modifications.
            - Added ability to execute seeds (germinate/shrivel) from the code
              base including in Migration files.
              
2015-02-24  Fixed the handling of plant requests for seed names that do not
            exist.
            
2015-02-23  Fixed a problem with the germinator not properly generating the 
            array of seeded versions, and allowing previously executed seeds to
            be run a second time.
