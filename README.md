# Germinator
Rails allows incremental database migrations, but only provides a single seed file (non-incremental) that causes problems when you try to run it during each application deploy.  Germinate provides a process very similar to the Rails database migrations that allows you to ensure that a data seed only gets run once in each environment.  It also provides a way to limit which Rails environments are allowed to run particular seeds, which helps protect data in sensitive environments (e.g. Production)

# Installation

To install the Germinator database table and the db/germinate directory in your Rails application:

##### 1. Add the gem to your gemfile:

```ruby
# myapplication/Gemfile
gem "germinator", github: "WowzaMediaSystems/germinator"
```

##### 2. In the terminal, make sure you're in your application directory:

```bash
$ cd /myapplication
```

##### 3. Run bundle install:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

##### 4. Execute the germinator installer:

```bash
$ rails generate install_germinator
```

You're done!!

# Working with Seeders


##### What is a Seeder?

Everything in the Germinator process revolves around a Seeder file.   These files are very similar to the migration files generated by Rails. By default all Seeder files are located in the germinate folder in your application, located here:

```bash
myapplication/db/germinate
```

Each file in this directory has a common naming convention that combines the timestamp from the time it was created, and a name to use as a reference for "planting" a seed file.  Example:

```bash
20150217100232_example_seeder.rb
```

#### Generating a new Seeder File

To generate a new Seeder file, in your application directory, you generate a germinator and give it a unique (not previously used) camel cased name:

```bash
$ rails generate germinator MyFirstSeeder
```

#### How the Seeder File is constructed

The seeder file is a standard ruby class that inherits the Germinator::Seed class. If you examine a newly generated seed file, the structure will look similar to this.  I've anotated each method with comments to show how they are used:

```ruby
class MyFirstSeederSeed < Germinator::Seed

  def environments
    # This method identifies which environments it is safe to execute this seed file in.
    # There are 4 valid responses:
    #
    # true                    -> Returning true says that this seed file can be run in any environment.
    # "development"           -> Returning a string with the name of one environment limits it execution 
    #                            to that one environment, in all other environments this file will be ignored.
    # ["development", "test"] -> Returning an array of strings limits the seed files execution to only the
    #                            environments named in the array.
    # false                   -> Return false says that this seed file is disabled and should not be executed.
  end

  def germinate
    # This method is executed during germinate rake task.  This method is only ever executed once.  This is modeled 
    # after the database migration "up" method.
    
    # You can put any valid rails commands in this block, or if you want to make the germainte and plant commands
    # execute the same code, you can just call:
    #
    # plant
  end

  def shrivel
    # This method is execute during the shrivel rake task.  This method is only ever executed once. This is modeled
    # after the database migration "down" method.
  end

  def plant
    # This method is executed during the plant rake task.  This method can be executed multiple times from the command
    # line.
    #
    # This command is good for data clean up or repetitive database tasks.
  end

end
```
