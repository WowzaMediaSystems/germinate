# Germinator
Rails allows incremental database migrations, but only provides a single seed file (non-incremental) that causes problems when you try to run it during each application deploy.  Germinate provides a process very similar to the Rails database migrations that allows you to ensure that a data seed only gets run once in each environment.  It also provides a way to limit which Rails environments are allowed to run particular seeds, which helps protect data in sensitive environments (e.g. Production)
